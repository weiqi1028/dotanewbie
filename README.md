The code is pretty ugly right now. It only wraps the Steam web API in Python, retrieve and store the information on the
Valve server into the local database.

***********************************************************************************************************************
Usage:
1. You need to register an API key first before you use this Java wrapper. Go to http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey and
get a key using your steam account. It does not matter what you enter for the domain name. Keep your API key.
2. In test.py file, replace YOUR_API_KEY with your API key.
3. Run dota2tables.sql in the sql folder.
4. Run test.py

A Python practice project.
